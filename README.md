# MUVERA Content Analyzer for Screaming Frog

An experimental implementation of Google's Multi-Vector Retrieval via Fixed Dimensional Encodings (MuVeRA) research, adapted for SEO content optimization.

## üöÄ Overview

MUVERA Content Analyzer applies cutting-edge multi-vector retrieval concepts to analyze and optimize web content for AI-powered search systems. While Google's MUVERA wants to focus on making search faster, this tool uses the same principles to help content creators understand how their content performs in vector-based retrieval systems. MUVERA is not live or implemented fully on search systems, yet. 

## üéØ What It Does

- **Splits content into optimal passages** (150-word targets) for vector embeddings
- **Analyzes each passage independently** with quality scores
- **Calculates retrieval potential** based on semantic richness
- **Identifies high-performing sections** for AI search systems
- **Provides actionable recommendations** for content optimization

## üìã Prerequisites

- Screaming Frog SEO Spider (v16.0 or higher)
- Active Gemini API key
- Basic understanding of JavaScript extraction in Screaming Frog

## üîß Installation

1. **Get your Gemini API Key**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Generate a new API key
   - Copy the key for use in step 3

2. **Open Screaming Frog**
   - Go to `Configuration > Custom > JavaScript`
   - Click "+" to add new JavaScript extraction

3. **Configure the extraction**
   - Name: `MUVERA Analysis`
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in the code with your actual Gemini API key:
   ```javascript
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

4. **Set extraction parameters**
   - Enabled: ‚úì
   - Extract: Text
   - Store: Yes

## üíª Usage

1. **Start crawling** your target website in Screaming Frog
2. **Navigate** to the "JavaScript" tab after crawling completes
3. **Find** the "MUVERA Analysis" column
4. **Export** results for detailed analysis

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Executive Summary
```
üéØ MuVeRA Executive Summary:
- Vector Optimization Status: ‚úÖ Excellent / ‚ö†Ô∏è Good / ‚ùå Needs Work
- Retrieval Readiness: ‚úÖ Ready / ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Optimization
- Total Passages: Number of content segments analyzed
- Recommendation: Deploy/Optimize first
```

### Key Metrics

- **Vector Quality** (0-100): How well each passage would perform as an embedding
- **Retrieval Score** (0-100): Likelihood of passage being retrieved for relevant queries
- **Semantic Weight**: Importance based on content structure and quality

### Passage Map Format
```
P01[150w] V:85 R:72 S:2.5 "Beginning of passage text..."
```
- P01: Passage ID
- 150w: Word count
- V:85: Vector quality score
- R:72: Retrieval score
- S:2.5: Semantic weight

## üß™ Experimental Nature

**Important**: This is an experimental adaptation of Google's research, not an official implementation. 

- We don't have access to Google's actual algorithms
- Configuration values are educated estimates
- Recommendations should be validated through real-world testing
- This tool provides insights, not guarantees

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Default values optimized for general content:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    TARGET_LENGTH: 150,    // Optimal passage length
    MIN_LENGTH: 50,        // Minimum for coherence
    MAX_LENGTH: 250,       // Maximum before complexity
    OVERLAP: 30,          // Context preservation
    TEXT_PREVIEW: 300,    // Analysis preview length
    VECTOR_DIMENSIONS: 768 // Standard embedding size
};
```

Adjust based on your content type:
- **Technical docs**: Increase TARGET_LENGTH to 200-250
- **News articles**: Decrease to 100-125
- **E-commerce**: Decrease to 75-100

## üîç How MUVERA Works

1. **Passage Extraction**: Content is split into semantically coherent segments
2. **Quality Assessment**: Each passage is scored for vector embedding potential
3. **Retrieval Scoring**: Passages are evaluated for search retrieval likelihood
4. **Analysis**: Gemini AI provides strategic recommendations
5. **Output**: Comprehensive report with actionable insights

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Regular Analysis**: Run MUVERA monthly to track content improvements
2. **Focus on Low Scores**: Prioritize passages with Vector Quality <60
3. **Test Changes**: Validate recommendations with real user data
4. **Iterate**: Content optimization is an ongoing process

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API Error: 403 Forbidden"**
- Check your API key is valid
- Ensure API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

**"No content found"**
- Verify JavaScript rendering is enabled in Screaming Frog
- Check if site uses heavy client-side rendering

**"Analysis timeout"**
- Site may have too much content per page
- Try crawling with reduced thread count

### Debug Mode

Add this to see raw passage data:
```javascript
console.log('Passages extracted:', passages.length);
console.log('First passage:', passages[0]);
```
